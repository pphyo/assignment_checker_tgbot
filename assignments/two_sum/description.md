*Assignment: Two Sum*

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Examples:**

- Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9` -> Output: `[0,1]`
- Input: `nums = [3,2,4]`, `target = 6` -> Output: `[1,2]`

---

**Instructions:**

1. Copy the code template below.
2. Save it as `TwoSum.java`.
3. Implement your logic inside the `solve` method.
4. Submit the `TwoSum.java` file by replying to the assignment message.

```java
class TwoSum {
    public int[] solve(int[] nums, int target) {
        // TODO: Write your implementation here
        return new int[2];
    }
}
```
